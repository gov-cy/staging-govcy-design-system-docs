The step by step navigation pattern presents an end to end journey in logical steps that helps users complete each step.

## When to use this pattern
gov.cy uses step by step navigation to represent end to end journeys:

- that have a specific start and end point
- that require the user to interact with several pieces of guidance or transactions on gov.cy
- where it’s helpful for the user to complete tasks in a specific order

## When not to use this pattern
Do not use the step by step pattern:

- when most of the guidance or services that make up the journey are not on GOV.CY
- when the user only needs to read guidance and not take an action
- when there’s no logical or helpful order to complete the tasks - for example, when you’re mostly presenting the user with a series of options
- inside a transactional service 

<div class="govcy-alert-notification govcy-br-5 govcy-br-info govcy-px-0">
    <div class="govcy-alert-notification-header govcy-fw-bold govcy-bg-info govcy-fs-4">Warning</div>
    <div class="govcy-alert-notification-body">
        <p class="govcy-pl-4 govcy-pt-6">
		<span class="govcy-warning-text govcy-d-inline">
			<span class="govcy-warning-text-icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span></span>
			Do not use this patter inside a transactional service. Use the <a href="../service_structure/#variant-2---break-the-service-into-sections">break the service into sections structure</a> which uses the <a href="../task-list-page">task list pattern</a> instead
		</p>
    </div>
</div>

## How it works
A step by step navigation journey can:

- bring together guidance and transactions from different departments, agencies, services and topics
- be completed in one go, or require the user to return to at different times
- link to content and services outside government
- include both online and offline actions

Step by step navigation information is displayed using a [step by step accordion](../../components/accordion/#step-by-step-accordion) in the [main section](../../getting-started/page-template/#sections). The component uses JavaScript. To use it with the gov.cy [developer assets](../../getting-started/developer-assets/), make sure to include the main JavaScript file in your page.

Step by step navigation is displayed in 2 ways.

1. As a standalone page.

*Example*
[Open in new tab](../../samples/step-by-step-default/){rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"}

<iframe src="../../samples/step-by-step-default/" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="govcy-br-1 govcy-br-standard govcy-mb-4" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>

2. On the right hand sidebar of content pages that are part of the step by step navigation.

*Example*
[Open in new tab](../../samples/step-by-step-two-thirds/){rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"}

<iframe src="../../samples/step-by-step-two-thirds/" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="govcy-br-1 govcy-br-standard govcy-mb-4" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>

Remember that step by step navigation is not for use within transactional services.

Content pages that are part of the step by step navigation should always have a link at the top that goes to the standalone step by step page.

*Example*
[Open in new tab](../../samples/step-page/){rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"}

<iframe src="../../samples/step-page/" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="govcy-br-1 govcy-br-standard govcy-mb-4" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>

You can find the code of the link to section below:
```html
<div class="govcy-article-part-warning govcy-bg-light">
	<p class="govcy-fw-bold govcy-mb-3">Part of</p>
	<a href="#">Learn to drive a car: step by step</a>
</div>
```
### Elements of step by step navigation

#### Steps

A step is a task or group of tasks that a user can complete as part of the journey. They appear in the pattern as numbered sections. The user can click on the step to expand it.

#### Tasks

A task is an action you need to take or piece of content you need to read to help you complete a step. They appear as a single link or a list of links.

Different tasks can link to the same service or piece of content.

You can present tasks in bullet points if you need to show:

- different ways to perform the same task - for example, different versions of a form to download
- different conditions that change how the user should complete the task

### Order steps according to user needs

Steps and tasks should be listed in the order users need to complete them.

If there is not a set order, they should be listed in an order that helps the user.

For example, ‘Agree a contract and salary’ is listed as step 4 in ‘Employ someone: step by step’ although it can be completed earlier.

### Use both ‘and’ and ‘or’

Use ‘and’ to show when you can or must complete steps at the same time. You can use ‘and’ for more than 2 steps.

Use ‘or’ to show when there’s a choice between 2 steps, or when a task must be completed in a different way based the user’s circumstances or eligibility.

*Example with `and`*
[Open in new tab](../../samples/step-by-step-and/){rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"}

<iframe src="../../samples/step-by-step-and/" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="govcy-br-1 govcy-br-standard govcy-mb-4" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>

*Example with `or`*
[Open in new tab](../../samples/step-by-step-or/){rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"}

<iframe src="../../samples/step-by-step-or/" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="govcy-br-1 govcy-br-standard govcy-mb-4" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>

### Costs

If there is a cost for completing a task, show it after the link text.

### Text within a step

Only include text in the step if it gives:

- essential context that the user needs before they click on the link
- the conditions the user needs to meet to complete the task - for example, if only some users can do it

## Accessibility
Be sure to follow the accessibility recommendations for the [accordion component](../../components/accordion/#accessibility).
