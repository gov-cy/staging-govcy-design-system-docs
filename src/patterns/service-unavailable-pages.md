Tell the user a service is unavailable on purpose. These are also known as 503 and shutter pages.

## When to use this pattern 

Use a service unavailable page when a service has been closed on purpose. This could be for a specific period of time or permanently. 

If there is a problem with the service, use a [there is a problem with the service page](../there-is-a-problem). 

Have a general page in case you need to close a service and do not have time to update the page. As soon as you know when the service will be available, update the page. 

## How it works 

The page should have: 
- as the page title: 
  - in Greek ‘Λυπούμαστε, η ιστοσελίδα είναι προσωρινά μη διαθέσιμη – service name – gov.cy’ 
  - in English: ‘Sorry, the website is temporarily unavailable – service name – gov.cy ’ 
- as the H1 
  - in Greek: ‘Λυπούμαστε, η ιστοσελίδα είναι προσωρινά μη διαθέσιμη’ 
  - in English: ‘Sorry, the website is temporarily unavailable’ 
- if know the day, date and time it is going to be available or what to do if it is permanently closed 
- if possible, information about what has happened to their answers if they are in the middle of a transaction 
- contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need 
- a link to another service, if they can use it to do what they came to do 

Have clear and concise content and do not use: 
- breadcrumbs 
- vague, unhelpful words like maintenance, improvements 
- red text to warn people 

*Example in Greek*
<div class="govcy-container govcy-p-4  govcy-br-1 govcy-br-standard govcy-mb-4">
<!--beforeMain-->
<!--main-->
<main class="govcy-container" id="mainContainer">
    <h1>Λυπούμαστε, η ιστοσελίδα είναι προσωρινά μη διαθέσιμη</h1> 
    <p>Δοκιμάστε ξανά αργότερα. </p>
</main>
</div>

*Example in English*
<div class="govcy-container govcy-p-4  govcy-br-1 govcy-br-standard govcy-mb-4">
<!--beforeMain-->
<!--main-->
<main class="govcy-container" id="mainContainer">
    <h1>Sorry, the website is temporarily unavailable</h1> 
    <p>Try again later. </p>
</main>
</div>
