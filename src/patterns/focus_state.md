Focus states let users that use keyboards or other devices to navigate through a page, know which element they’re currently on and is ready to be interacted with.

Focus states in the GOV.CY Design System use a combination of yellow (button active / input focus colour) and black (body colour). The exact colour values are represented in the [colours page](../../styles/colour). 

If you use the [Design System’s CSS](../../getting_started/#css-and-javascript) for implementing components, the focus states are implemented by default.
