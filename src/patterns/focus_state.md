Focus states let users that use keyboards or other devices to navigate through a page, know which element they’re currently on and is ready to be interacted with.

Focus states in the Unified Design System use a combination of yellow (button active / input focus colour) and black (body colour). The exact colour values are represented in the [colours page](../../styles/colour)

If you use the [gov.cy CSS](../../getting-started/developer-assets/) for implementing components, the focus states are implemented by default.
