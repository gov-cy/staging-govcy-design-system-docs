Help users enter a date.

## When to use this pattern
Follow this pattern whenever you need users to provide or view a date as part of your service.

## How it works

If you are asking for a date that is not in the near future or recent past, for example birth date, use the [date input component](../../components/date_input/).

If you are asking for a date that is in the near future or recent past, for example appointment date, you can use a calendar like date picker.

## How to write dates

Display dates in the format `DD/MM/YYYY`, for example 13/11/2021.
