When designing and implementing websites and services throughout gov.cy, consider the following principles.
 
## 1. Citizen centred 
Design products that allows the user to easily achieve their goals.
## 2. Seamless
Enables users to complete their task as seamlessly as possible.
## 3. Do less
Allow the user to complete their goal in the smallest number of steps possible without cramming a lot of information in one screen.
## 4. Simple
Build products that are simple, natural, and easily understood by the users.
## 5. Consistent
Websites and services should look and feel the same to users regardless if different government departments and backend systems are involved.

People expect services to work in a certain way based on what they’ve seen or used before, so make sure to use the ==design patterns==
## 6. Don’t reinvent the wheel
Reuse any design elements that have already been designed or developed within the gov.cy Design System.
## 7. Include everyone
Provide products that everyone can use, including people with disabilities. Make sure to comply with the EN 301 549 Standard. 
## 8. Mobile first
Most of our products will be used by mobile devices. so design the online experience for mobiles before designing for desktops.
## 9. Responsive​
Make sure gov.cy products play well both in any device.
