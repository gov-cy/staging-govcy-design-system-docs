The purpose of the gov.cy Unified Design System is to create a citizen centric, consistent, clean and intuitive user experience through the services and websites of gov.cy that is accessible to everyone”​

When designing and implementing websites and services throughout gov.cy, consider the following principles.
 
## 1. Citizen centred 
Design products that allow users to easily achieve their goals.
## 2. Seamless
Enable users to complete their task as seamlessly as possible.
## 3. Do less
Allow users to complete their goals in the smallest number of steps possible without cramming too much information onto one screen.
## 4. Simple
Build products that are intuitive and easy to understand for users.
## 5. Clarity
Design products that are clean and uncluttered, presenting information and interactive elements in a way that focuses users on the task at hand. Avoid unnecessary complexity and distractions to maintain a clear and straightforward user experience.
## 6. Consistent
Ensure websites and services look and feel the same to users, regardless of the different government departments and backend systems involved. Use design styles, components and patterns consistently to meet user expectations.
## 7. Don’t reinvent the wheel
Reuse any design elements that have already been designed or developed within the gov.cy Design System.
## 8. Include everyone
Provide products that everyone can use, including people with disabilities. Make sure to comply with the EN 301 549 Standard.
## 9. Mobile first
Design the online experience for mobile devices before designing for desktops, as most of our products will be used on mobile devices.
## 10. Responsive​
Ensure gov.cy products work well on any device.
