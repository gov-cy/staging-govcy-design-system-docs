The easiest way to get started is to use the jsdelvr CDN to include the gov.cy developer assets in your code, as explained below. 

Alternatively you can download the [gov.cy starter kit]({{site.distDownload}}), unzip it and include it in your project. 

The following file structure is included in the starter kit:
```html
.
+-- css
|   +-- govcy.uds.css
+-- img
|   +-- ...
+-- JS
|   +-- govcy.uds.js
|   +-- locales
|       +-- govcy.datepicker.el.js
|       +-- govcy.datepicker.en.js
+-- manifest.json
```

All HTML code examples in this website utilizes the classes, styling and behaviour defined in this CSS and JS files of our developer assets.

## CSS
To add the gov.cy styles using our developer assets, add the CSS either using the CDN or using the downloaded starter kit.

```html

{{ site.cssCDN }}
```

```
